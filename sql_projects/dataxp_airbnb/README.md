### Dataxp Airbnb Project

**Please note that this project is still a work in progress.**

This project is a part of the Dataxp Airbnb project, where users were asked to identify trends in the Airbnb marketplace.

For this project, New York City was chosen for analysis, and the goal is to assist homeowners in assessing the potential value of their property if they are considering listing it.

The Airbnb data can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), and the StreetEasy data can be found [here](https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/?agg=Total&metric=Inventory&type=Rentals&bedrooms=Any%20Bedrooms&property=Any%20Property%20Type&minDate=2010-01-01&maxDate=2021-08-01&area=Manhattan). The StreetEasy data will eventually be used to show the median monthly rent price alongside the mean average price per night, per neighborhood.

Tableau visualizations can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eric7616/viz/NYCAirbnbWorkinProgress/Story1), and are still a work in progress.

**Important Considerations** 

New York City has specific short-term rental laws that need to be considered prior to making hosting decisions. This information can be found [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/information-for-hosts.page). Please keep this information in mind when viewing the data.
